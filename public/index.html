<p>I do have quite a few interests and hobbies I would say a good balance of activities, self development and social</p>

<h2>My active life</h2>

    <li>going jogging a few times a week</li>

<h2> Self Development</h2>
<p>see the thing is in regards to self development i don't really do much aside from
    <ul>
        <li>Read books physically or listen to books using audible</li>
        <li>Self learning how to write code</li>
        <li>My Personal journey in developing my faith</li>
    </ul>
    these are my personal things I enjoy doing for self development I wouldn't say I stick to it all the time but I do make a good effort.

<h2>Social</h2>
<p>
    contrary to what most may believe I think im quite well balanced when it comes to 
    my social life with a good amount of time spent with the people I love such as Family and friends,
    wether it's been spent out going for brunch or doing activities or just going to pop by for a visit I enjoy the quality time.
